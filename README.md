## üéØ Purpose

This project was developed to:
- Learn full-stack web development fundamentals with Flask
- Explore AI API integration and prompt engineering techniques
- Master file upload handling in web applications
- Practice secure environment configuration and API key management
- Build a practical tool that addresses real-world data organization challenges

The Data Sorting Assistant serves as both a learning project and a functional utility for anyone dealing with unstructured or messy data that needs intelligent organization.
